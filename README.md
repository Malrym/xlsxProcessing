# xlsxProcessing
This if my first Programm interacting with xlsx-files, Python and an MySQL Database. Works now for all Sigle-Sheeted Excel Tables. File has to be named after existing MySQL-Table. Still Work in Progress

Hey everyone! Since this is my first multi-purpose Programm I want to document my Changes and Updates of this.
#0.0.1 Made this Work so I could use it on one Excel-File i created.
#0.0.2 Some Changes to the Commands and Synthax
#0.0.3 Almost made it Work for all Files, still Work in Progress
#0.1.1 Reduced the Amount of inputs Required from the User. 
  Now features all XLSX-Files. 
  Table with the same Name as the XLSX-Filename required.
  Changed all While-Loops used to For-Loops, since they're here WAY more effective.
  Added new Modules to make things easier.
  
Created with the Spyder IDE provived by Anaconda 3.
